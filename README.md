# Zomato---Data-Analysis-using-Python

Leveraged Python to conduct an in-depth analysis of Zomato's restaurant data, uncovering patterns in customer behavior and dining preferences. This project uses data visualization to reveal critical insights into what drives restaurant success in a competitive market.

Questions for Analysis:
 1) What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
 2 How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
 3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
 4)Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
 5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
 6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?
